      a group of individuals who have spent many past seasons living
      and serving in different nations around the world. They gave their lives away to help
      those who have lost everything in the midst of the chaos of this world. Young and passionate
      friends became inspired visionaries to make a difference in the lives of those who can't make
      a difference for themselves. Although tremendous progress has been made in the continuing
      initiatives of United Relief, there is still much work to be done.
